# Autonomous Vehicle Suspension Tuning using Reinforcement Learning

## 🚗 Project Overview

This project implements an advanced reinforcement learning system for real-time active suspension control in autonomous vehicles. The system uses Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms to optimize vehicle comfort and handling by dynamically adjusting suspension parameters based on road conditions and vehicle dynamics.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional passive suspension systems cannot adapt to varying road conditions, leading to suboptimal ride comfort and vehicle stability. Active suspension systems require sophisticated control algorithms that can balance multiple competing objectives:
- **Ride Comfort**: Minimize body acceleration and vibrations
- **Vehicle Stability**: Maintain tire contact and reduce body roll
- **Energy Efficiency**: Optimize actuator power consumption
- **Safety**: Ensure suspension travel limits and system stability

## 🔬 Technical Approach

### Core Components
- **Quarter-Car Dynamics Model**: Physics-based simulation with realistic vehicle parameters
- **Custom Gym Environment**: Reinforcement learning environment with continuous action/observation spaces
- **Multi-Algorithm Support**: DDPG, TD3, and PPO implementations
- **Curriculum Learning**: Progressive training from easy to challenging road conditions
- **Performance Analysis**: ISO 2631-1 compliant comfort metrics

### Key Features
- **Realistic Road Simulation**: ISO 8608 road roughness standards (Classes A-D)
- **Multi-Objective Optimization**: Balanced reward function for comfort vs. handling
- **Real-Time Capability**: Optimized for embedded system deployment
- **Safety Constraints**: Built-in suspension travel and stability limits
